# React Redux Reducer and Selector Exercise

This repository contains exercises related to building reducers, actions, and selectors using React and Redux. The exercises are structured into tasks, each focusing on specific aspects of Redux state management and selector creation.

## Tasks Overview

1. **Task 0: Basic Reducer**
   - Create a basic reducer for UI state.
   - Define initial state and actions.
   - Write tests for the reducer.

2. **Task 1: Use Immutable for the UI Reducer**
   - Integrate Immutable.js into the UI reducer for better state management.
   - Update reducer functions and tests accordingly.

3. **Task 2: Create a Reducer for Courses**
   - Implement a reducer for handling course data.
   - Define actions for loading, selecting, and unselecting courses.
   - Write tests to ensure proper functionality.

4. **Task 3: Create a Reducer for Notifications**
   - Develop a reducer to manage notification data.
   - Define actions for loading, marking as read, and setting filters for notifications.
   - Write tests to validate the reducer behavior.

5. **Task 4: Normalizr & Immutable**
   - Implement normalization of data using Normalizr.
   - Utilize Immutable.js for efficient state updates.
   - Update reducers and tests to accommodate these changes.

6. **Task 5: Selectors**
   - Create selectors for accessing data from the state.
   - Write tests to ensure selector functionality.

## Folder Structure

The repository structure is organized as follows:

- Each task has its own directory (`task_0`, `task_1`, ..., `task_5`).
- Within each task directory, there is a `dashboard` subdirectory containing source files and tests.
- Source files include reducers, actions, selectors, and schema definitions.
- Tests are provided for each component to ensure functionality and maintainability.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the desired task directory.
3. Follow the instructions provided in the task description to complete the exercises.
4. Run tests to verify the correctness of your implementations.

## Requirements

- Node.js and npm/yarn for package management.
- Basic understanding of React, Redux, and state management concepts.
