# Webpack Project Setup

This project demonstrates a basic Webpack setup for bundling a simple JavaScript application that uses jQuery to manipulate the DOM. The setup includes installing Webpack and webpack-cli as development dependencies and jQuery as a production dependency.

## Project Structure

- `src/index.js`: The entry point for the application where jQuery is used to add paragraphs to the HTML document.
- `dist/index.html`: The HTML file that includes the bundled JavaScript code.
- `package.json`: Contains metadata and dependency information for the project.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (version 12.x.x as specified)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

## Installation

To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
